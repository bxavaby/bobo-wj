**Bobo** is a neon-lit joke generator built entirely with the front-end triad and python.  
It runs frontend-only, for now (check out [⧾ Technical Notes](#⧾-technical-notes)), gently falling back to a humorous note when the backend is offline.

## ⧾ Demo

⤷ [**Launch Bobo on GitHub Pages**](https://bxavaby.github.io/bobo-wj/)

---

## ⧾ Features

- Pure **frontend** — no dependencies, no build system
- Ready for backend plug-in via Flask + Ollama (optional)
- Humor **mode selector** — Clean, Dark, Roast, Geokes
- Automatic **fallback**
- Retro-futuristic UI with **glitch effects** and a cursor trail

---

## ⧾ Technical Notes

- The current version is **frontend-only** and uses a Python backend powered by a locally hosted **fine-tuned LLM**
- Backend connectivity was removed for GitHub Pages hosting
- You can reintroduce backend support by:
  - Modifying the `fetch` logic in `tool.html`
  - Running a lightweight Python script to:
    - Deploy a Flask app that communicates with the frontend
    - Handle the joke generation logic via your preferred LLM (HuggingFace, Ollama, i.a.)

## ⧾ Future Ideas

- Voice generation (text-to-speech)
- Bobo, the Pocket Jester
